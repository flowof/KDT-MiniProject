       "'\\n\"Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the\\nBuonapartes. But I warn you, if you don\\'t tell me that this means war,\\nif you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by\\nthat Antichrist- I really believe he is Antichrist- I will have\\nnothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer\\nmy \\'faithful slave,\\' as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see\\nI have frightened you- sit down and tell me all the news.\"\\n\\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna\\nPavlovna Scherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya\\nFedorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man\\nof high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her\\nreception. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as\\nshe said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in\\nSt. Petersburg, used only by the elite.\\n\\nAll her invitations without exception, written in French, and\\ndelivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\\n\\n\"If you have nothing better to do, Count [or Prince], and if the\\nprospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too\\nterrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10-\\nAnnette Scherer.\"\\n\\n\"Heavens! what a virulent attack!\" replied the prince, not in the\\nleast disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing\\nan embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had\\nstars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke\\nin that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but\\nthought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a\\nman of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went\\nup to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald,\\nscented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the\\nsofa.\\n\\n\"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend\\'s\\nmind at rest,\" said he without altering his tone, beneath the\\npoliteness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even\\nirony could be discerned.\\n\\n\"Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times\\nlike these if one has any feeling?\" said Anna Pavlovna. \"You are\\nstaying the whole evening, I hope?\"\\n\\n\"And the fete at the English ambassador\\'s? Today is Wednesday. I\\nmust put in an appearance there,\" said the prince. \"My daughter is\\ncoming for me to take me there.\"\\n\\n\"I thought today\\'s fete had been canceled. I confess all these\\nfestivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.\"\\n\\n\"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would\\nhave been put off,\" said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by\\nforce of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev\\'s\\ndispatch? You know everything.\"\\n\\n\"What can one say about it?\" replied the prince in a cold,\\nlistless tone. \"What has been decided? They have decided that\\nBuonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to\\nburn ours.\"\\n\\nPrince Vasili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a\\nstale part. Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty\\nyears, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an\\nenthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she\\ndid not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to\\ndisappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile\\nwhich, though it did not suit her faded features, always played\\nround her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual\\nconsciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor\\ncould, nor considered it necessary, to correct.\\n\\nIn the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovna\\nburst out:\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don\\'t understand\\nthings, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war.\\nShe is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious\\nsovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is\\nthe one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to\\nperform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble\\nthat God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and\\ncrush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible than\\never in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must\\navenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely\\non?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot\\nunderstand the Emperor Alexander\\'s loftiness of soul. She has\\nrefused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some\\nsecret motive in our actions. What answer did Novosiltsev get? None.\\nThe English have not understood and cannot understand the\\nself-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only\\ndesires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! And\\nwhat little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has\\nalways declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe\\nis powerless before him.... And I don\\'t believe a word that Hardenburg\\nsays, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just a\\ntrap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored\\nmonarch. He will save Europe!\"\\n\\nShe suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.\\n\\n\"I think,\" said the prince with a smile, \"that if you had been\\nsent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the\\nKing of Prussia\\'s consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you\\ngive me a cup of tea?\"\\n\\n\"In a moment. A propos,\" she added, becoming calm again, \"I am\\nexpecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart,\\nwho is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of\\nthe best French families. He is one of the genuine emigres, the good\\nones. And also the Abbe Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He\\nhas been received by the Emperor. Had you heard?\"\\n\\n\"I shall be delighted to meet them,\" said the prince. \"But tell me,\"\\nhe added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred\\nto him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive\\nof his visit, \"is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke\\nto be appointed first secretary at Vienna?
